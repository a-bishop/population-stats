## Population Stats

A single page application built with React and the D3 library. Compares current populations between up to six countries and shows today's and tomorrow's world population in a scrolling ticker.

Data was previously consumed from the World Population API, which is no longer available. The populations are now hardcoded at estimated 2019 values for demonstration purposes.
